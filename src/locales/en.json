    "warning": {
      "title": "Beware of scammers asking for your 12-word seed!",
      "description": "Grimm App is self-custodial: you (and only you) have the key controlling the funds in the wallet. This key is made of a 12-word mnemonic, known as a 'seed'. You can find it in the app settings. Make a backup, and keep it safe. If you lose your seed, we can't help you.",
      "advice": "Do not enter your seed in any websites or Google forms. Our support team will never ask for it."
    },
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "What is a self-custodial wallet?",
        "answer": "A self-custodial wallet is a type of wallet where you have full control and ownership of your private keys. This means you are the only one with access to your funds, without relying on a third party. It's crucial to securely back up your private keys to avoid losing access to your Bitcoin."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my personal information secure?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! We prioritize the privacy and security of your data. All personal information is securely stored and never shared with third parties without your explicit consent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the app customizable?",
        "answer": "Yes, our app is designed to be customizable. You can personalize the appearance and certain features to suit your preferences, creating a unique user experience."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I lose my private key?",
        "answer": "As a self-custodial wallet, you are the sole owner of your private keys. If you lose them, we cannot recover them for you. We strongly recommend securely backing up your private keys in a safe place."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I get help if I encounter an issue?",
        "answer": "Our support team is here to assist you. You can contact us directly through the app or send an email to our customer support at support@usegrimm.app. We'll respond to your inquiries as quickly as possible."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Bitcoin?",
        "answer": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows peer-to-peer payments without requiring a central bank or middleman. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. Bitcoin can be used for sending value globally, storing wealth, and powering new financial applications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the Lightning Network?",
        "answer": "The Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It enables instant, low-cost payments by opening payment channels between participants and settling on-chain only when necessary. Lightning is ideal for micro-payments and high-frequency transfers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are satoshis (sats)?",
        "answer": "A satoshi (sats) is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. One Bitcoin equals 100,000,000 satoshis. We often display balances in sats for precision, especially for small Lightning payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Grimm App collect any data from its users?",
        "answer": "We collect only the minimum data necessary to operate the service. This may include phone number verification, and anonymized telemetry (if enabled). We never collect your seed phrase. Personal data handling follows our Privacy Policy and is only used with your consent."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Grimm App store my seed phrase?",
        "answer": "Your seed phrase is stored locally on your device only, encrypted if you choose device-level secure storage. Grimm App never uploads or has access to your seed phrase. We provide clear guidance for backing up your seed securely (off-device backups, paper backup, hardware wallet recommendations)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I contact Grimm App?",
        "answer": "You can contact our support team through the app's support section or by email at support@usegrimm.app. For compliance and legal matters, use compliance@usegrimm.app. Please do not share your seed or private keys with support."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if Grimm App disappears?",
        "answer": "If Grimm App ceases operation, your funds remain yours as long as you have your seed phrase. Because Grimm is self-custodial, you can restore your wallet using any compatible Bitcoin/Lightning wallet that supports the same seed format. We recommend keeping a secure, offline backup of your seed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which countries are unable to download?",
        "answer": "Availability depends on app store policies and local laws. Grimm App may be unavailable in jurisdictions with strict crypto restrictions. Check the app store listing for your country or contact support for the latest availability information."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to complete KYC to create a Grimm App account?",
        "answer": "No â€” creating a basic self-custodial wallet usually does not require KYC. However, to access fiat features such as buying/selling Bitcoin or to lift certain limits, you will need to complete identity verification (KYC) as required by local regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Grimm App ensure my funds are secure?",
        "answer": "Grimm App uses a self-custodial design: private keys remain under your control. We never hold custody of your funds. The app leverages device secure storage, encryption, and best practices for handling secrets. For Lightning functionality we use a well-audited SDK (Breez) and follow secure patterns for channel management. We also encourage users to backup their seed phrases offline."
